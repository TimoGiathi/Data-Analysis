# Python Wk-7 Assignment: Data Analysis and Visualization

## Overview

This assignment demonstrates how to load, explore, analyze, and visualize a dataset using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. The Iris dataset is used as an example for all tasks.

## Contents

- `iris_analysis.py`: Python script that performs all required steps for the assignment.
- `README.md`: Explains the purpose, steps, and requirements of the assignment.

## Tasks Covered

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**

   - Loads the Iris dataset using scikit-learn and pandas.
   - Displays the first few rows and explores the structure (data types, missing values).
   - Handles missing values if present.

2. **Basic Data Analysis**

   - Computes basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).
   - Groups data by species and computes mean values.
   - Identifies patterns and findings from the analysis.

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Creates four types of plots:
     - Line chart (trends over index, as time is not present)
     - Bar chart (average petal length per species)
     - Histogram (distribution of sepal length)
     - Scatter plot (sepal length vs. petal length by species)
   - All plots are customized with titles, axis labels, and legends.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed.
2. Required packages: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn` (these are installed in the provided environment).
3. Run the script using the following command:
   ```
   "C:/Users/USER/Desktop/Python Assignments/Python Wk-7 Assignment/.venv/Scripts/python.exe" iris_analysis.py
   ```
4. The script will display outputs and plots in sequence.

## Notes

- The script includes error handling for dataset loading and missing values.
- All visualizations are shown using matplotlib and seaborn for better presentation.
- The assignment can be adapted to other datasets by modifying the data loading section.
